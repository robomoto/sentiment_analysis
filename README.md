# sentiment_analysis
Playing in sklearn

Starting from an Natural Language Processing assignment in a course at: 
https://deeplearningcourses.com/c/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python

I built a benchmarker to display the time and fit score of a variety of models used for binary classification.
It doesn't get too in depth--just prints to the console and writes to a file, letting you see how different models 
compare at the task of sentiment analysis, specifically for the electronics reviews in the original assignment (http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/index2.html).

There are several ways it could be extended.  The benchmarker could add visualization using matplotlib, display the most predictive words, just for a couple examples.
Additionally, currently I don't have any function to let the user describe the model, apart from the over-all fit.
